CS students have a good chance to get 4-5 lpa package and even 10 lpa offered by microsoft. For mechanical branch ,lot of companies comes for recruitment .Avg package for mechanical is around 2.5 lpa. Few companies come for core electrical jobs . Same is the case for aerospace . Many IT companies recruit students from all branches except civil. Now ,here comes the other aspect except civil .For civil engineering most of the core companies that comes recruit for sales profile not civil engineering profile.If any IT company comes ,Civil is the only field which is not eligible except Wipro .Out of total students of civil engineering batch ,only 1 or 2 students get placed and that not in civil but on different field like marketing or sales. Apart from placement ,Labs are good as far as cs field is concerned.Faculties are good and supportive .College environment is nice .Companies come in large number mainly for IT jobs . Various recruiter during 2016- 2017 session are Microsoft ,Uber, Tata technologies, Tech mahindra ,Cognizant ,Wipro etc One can check it from www.amity.edu where all companies that comes for recruitment along with the results are disclosed.
